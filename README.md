The Spoofed-Cybersecurity-Training-Site simulates a realistic phishing environment, where users are prompted to interact with a fake login page designed to look like an official site. The objective is to familiarize trainees with potential cyber threats and how to detect them, without exposing them to real risks.

Fake Login Page: Mimics real-world sites to encourage phishing recognition training.

Credential Capture: Collects the inputted credentials for analysis.

Modular Design: Easily customizable for different types of phishing simulations (e.g., social media, email).

Interactive Feedback: Provides users with feedback after they submit their credentials, educating them on the risk.
